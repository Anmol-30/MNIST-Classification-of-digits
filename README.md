Keras is a very versatile, deep learning library that can run on-top-of several other deep learning frameworks — it supports Tensorflow, Theano and Microsoft CNTK, with Tensorflow being the default. Keras can be used both with a CPU as well as a GPU.

For this example, I am using Keras configured with Tensorflow on a CPU machine — for a simple model like MNIST, a CPU configuration suffices. For any serious deep learning projects, a GPU is highly recommended otherwise complex ML models will take excruciatingly long to train.

# MNIST-Classification-of-digits

Developed a simple deep learning classifier using Keras library to achieve 98.76% accuracy on the MNIST digits database. Also, built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification.
The MNIST dataset is an image dataset of handwritten digits. It has has 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which are grayscale 28 x 28 sized images.
