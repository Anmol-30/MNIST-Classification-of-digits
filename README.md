# MNIST-Classification-of-digits

Developed a simple deep learning classifier using Keras library to achieve 98.76% accuracy on the MNIST digits database. Also, built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification.
The MNIST dataset is an image dataset of handwritten digits. It has has 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which are grayscale 28 x 28 sized images.
